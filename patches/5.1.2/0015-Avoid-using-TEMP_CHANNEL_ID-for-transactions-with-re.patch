Subject: [PATCH 15/20] Avoid using TEMP_CHANNEL_ID for transactions with
 responses

Otherwise, this happens:
  1. csi5_fops uses TEMP_CHANNEL_ID for a temporary transaction
  2. capture-ivc allocates TEMP_CHANNEL_ID as a transaction
  3. code uses TEMP_CHANNEL_ID via capture-ivc to send something
  4. capture-ivc sees a responses on TEMP_CHANNEL_ID, and freaks out
     because it's not to its message
